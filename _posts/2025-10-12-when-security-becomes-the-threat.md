title: "When Security Becomes the Threat"

A fellow engineer I know recently got a new laptop from his company. Top-of-the-line specs, everything you'd want in a developer machine. On paper, it should have been blazing fast. In practice, it ran like a ten-year-old budget notebook.

The reason wasn't the hardware. It was the six different security products preinstalled on it.

## When "Defense in Depth" Goes Too Deep

I get it. Companies have to protect their assets. Data breaches are costly, compliance requirements are strict, and zero trust is the current buzzword in every boardroom. But somewhere along the line, security in corporate IT became less about risk reduction and more about control.

In this case, there was traditional antivirus software, an endpoint monitoring agent that looks for suspicious behavior, a data protection tool that tries to stop sensitive files from leaving the company, a VPN client, a privileged access agent, and some mysterious "threat monitoring" overlay. Each came from a different vendor, each installed its own kernel driver, and each demanded a slice of CPU and I/O.

The result? The machine struggled just to launch Visual Studio Code. Scripts that used to run instantly were blocked or quarantined. Even PowerShell profiles failed to load because one of the agents flagged them as "suspicious activity."

## Security Paralysis

This isn't just inconvenience. It's a kind of organizational paralysis. Developers aren't just slowed down; they're disabled. The very people building and maintaining secure systems can't do their jobs because security software thinks they're the threat.

Trying to get exceptions made is its own ordeal. You open a ticket, wait for someone in another department to approve it, and eventually get told, "We can't whitelist that due to policy." You send documentation, screenshots, and maybe even a knowledge base article, but it doesn't matter because the process is designed to prevent change, not to enable productivity.

Meanwhile, every hour wasted waiting for a security exception is an hour of developer salary burned on nothing.

## The Hidden Cost of Over-Security

Developers are expensive. So are the tools they use. But somehow, organizations are fine wasting thousands of dollars per week in lost productivity because one of these agents can't tell the difference between a malicious upload and a legitimate build artifact.

This is where the logic breaks down. The goal of security is to protect value, not to destroy it through inefficiency.

When an engineer can't build, test, or run code because half the system is under quarantine, the company hasn't reduced its attack surface. It has only created a new internal one: frustration, delay, and shadow IT workarounds.

## Security Should Be Invisible, Not Obstructive

The best security is the kind you don't notice. It quietly protects you in the background while you do your job.

Instead, what we often get is layer upon layer of overlapping products configured by people who don't understand developer workflows. The intent is good, but the execution punishes the wrong group. Developers end up fighting the tools more than they fight the bugs.

Security and productivity don't have to be enemies. The people responsible for securing the environment need to work with those who actually use it. Understand what developers do day to day, where the real risks are, and where the tools are just getting in the way.

## Final Thoughts

The irony is that many of these problems start from good intentions. "Let's make sure we're compliant." "Let's add an extra layer of defense." But when those layers pile up without coordination or context, they turn into barriers instead of safeguards.

The question every IT and security leader should ask is simple:
**Are we protecting our developers, or are we protecting ourselves from them?**
